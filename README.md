### [HTTP Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/)
HTTP is a set of protocols designed to enable communication between clients and servers. It works as a request-response         protocol between a client and server.A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.
So, to request a response from the server, there are mainly two methods:
 - GET : to request data from the server.
 - POST : to submit data to be processed to the server.
